Elementary math game teaching single digit addition.

AWS deployed link: https://master.dmo5s8wokt3sm.amplifyapp.com/

The technology used is HTML, CSS, Javascript, Photoshop, & AWS. The landing page describes how to play & the button links to the loop of math questions within a set time limit. The user is given 10 seconds to solve each problem & is encouraged to answer a question per second to master the game. Once the overall time is up a results page is rendered listing the problems missed and the ratio of correct answers/total questions.

Creating games was a part of what sparked my interest into the software development & intend to cotinue making educational apps. My plans are to continue to add animations/transitions as well as a review option to focus on the problems missed.
